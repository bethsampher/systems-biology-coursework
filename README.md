This repository contains an IPython notebook including steps to download and process RNA sequencing data, run differential gene expression analyis with DESeq2 and model a circadian system. Addtionally, there is a PDF document containing details of the Cytoscape network generation, along with the filtered DESeq2 CSV used for this. Also included is the network exported in XGMML format, saved Cytoscape session and PNG files of the images in the PDF.
