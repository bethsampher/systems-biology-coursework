# Coursework MOD006203: Systems Biology Lab Report
This repository contains an IPython notebook including steps to download and process RNA sequencing data, run differential gene expression analyis with DESeq2 and model a circadian system. The resulting files from these analyses are stored in the repository. Addtionally, there is a document containing details of network generation in Cytoscape, along with the network in XGMML format and the saved Cytoscape session. The PNG files of the images in the document can also be found here.
